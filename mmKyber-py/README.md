#   mmKyber-py

Behavioral Python model and test vector generator for the mmKyber implementation.

-   Entirely compatible with the C version (produces the same test vectors.)
-   You can run a quick functional test with `make test`.
-   No dependencies apart from pycryptodome for SHAKE [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
