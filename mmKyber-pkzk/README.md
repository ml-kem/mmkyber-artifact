#   mmKyber-pkzk

We show how to create and verify LNP22 Zero-Knowledge proofs for mmKyber
public keys (this counters attacks using maliciously crafted public keys.)
We use the [LaZer](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1846.pdf) implementation
of LNP22 scheme (see below for references).

The ZK proofs show that the (s,e) secret variables are sampled from the
appropriate distribution; either binary {0, 1} or ternary {-1, 0, +1}.
The ternary case is handled by converting s and e into two binary vectors
(one for positive and another for negative coefficients), so the ternary
case has a double-wide witness.

Here are representative numbers with authors laptop (Ryzen 7 7840U.)

| Parameter Set | Dist. | Proof Size    | Proof time    | Verify time   |
|---------------|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| mmKyber-128   | tern  | 26473 bytes   | 0.078226 sec  | 0.040559 sec  |
| mmKyber-192   | bin   | 25261 bytes   | 0.075551 sec  | 0.042586 sec  |
| mmKyber-256   | bin   | 28022 bytes   | 0.105433 sec  | 0.056101 sec  |

Note that mmKyber-KEM and mmKyber-PKE have the same parameter sets
(keypairs are interchangeable) so these apply to both.

##  Building and Running

By defaul the code assumes that the
[https://github.com/lazer-crypto/lazer](https://github.com/lazer-crypto/lazer)
repository is available at
`../../lazer`, and that C code for mmKyber is at `../mmKyber-c`.
Please modify the `Makefile` and the shell scripts if you need to change this.

```
mmKyber-pkzk
├── Makefile              # for running the test
├── mm_proof.c            # test code for mmKyber with LaZer
├── mm_128_param.py       # mmKyber-128 params (LaZer input)
├── mm_128_param.h        # (autogenerated from .py)
├── mm_192_param.py       # mmKyber-192 params (LaZer input)

├── mm_256_param.py       # mmKyber-256 params (LaZer input)
├── mm_256_param.h        # (autogenerated from .py)
├── run_lazer.sh          # run LaZer code generator to recreate param.h files
├── proof_sizes.sh        # script to benchmark the the proof system
├── proof.log             # example output from proof_sizes.sh
└── README.md             # this file
```

If everything is set up, you can run `proof_sizes.sh` to create a report
`proof.log` about the proof sizes. Note that there is no need to re-create
the header files.
